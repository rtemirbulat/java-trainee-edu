<h1>TO-DO</h1>
Create 2 Java classes -“Ticket” and “TicketService”
The “Ticket" class should have the following variables:
<li> ID (max 4 digits and/or chars)</li>
<li> concert hall (max 10 chars)</li>
<li> event code (3 digits)</li>
<li>time (Unix timestamp)</li>
<li> is promo</li>
<li>stadium sector (from ‘A’ to ‘C’)</li>
<li> max allowed backpack weight in kg (with grams precision) </li>
  <
Choose the [name] [data type], [access modifier] and [variable type] carefully, depending on a [variable] purpose.
There should be the ability to create a Ticket instance with all parameters initialised and also a limited one - [concert hall], [event code] and
[time].
<h2>backlog: getters, setters, testing</h2>
